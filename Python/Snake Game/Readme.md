### Description

Snake Game is a simple game where the player controls a snake and must avoid the walls.
It will be a 2d game with a small snake and some random food.

The snake will start off small and will grow in size as it eats the food. The food will be randomly swapped each time it is eaten.

There will be a score system which keeps track of the amount of food the snake has eaten.

The game will end when the snake either collides with the wall or itself.
