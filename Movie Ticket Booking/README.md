# Movie Ticket Booking

## About the project :
- This project is about a GUI for movie ticket booking
- The GUI has been developed using python programming.
- The database which is connected to this GUI is built using MySQL workbench.
- We have imported a library named "mysql-connector-python", which plays an important role in integration of the python program and MySQL.
- We can book a ticket for the available movies.
- After booking a ticket, we can see that there is a reduction of the tickets booked.
- We have created a file named movies.sql, in which we can see all the create table statements, and some insert statements for our database.

## Tech-stack :
- Python
- SQL
